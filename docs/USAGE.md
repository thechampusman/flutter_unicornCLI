    ```

### 🐧 Linux & 🍏 macOS
1. Download the `f` binary for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/thechampusman/flutter_unicornCLI/releases)
   *(or compile it yourself with `dart compile exe bin/flutterunicorn.dart -o f` on your platform)*
2. Move it to a folder in your PATH, e.g.:
    ```sh
    sudo mv f /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    or (if you have a `~/bin` in your PATH):
    ```sh
    mv f ~/bin/
    ```
3. Make it executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/f
    ```
4. Use from any terminal:
    ```sh
    f -h
    ```
