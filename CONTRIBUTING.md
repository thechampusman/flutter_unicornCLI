First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

We welcome all contributions, bug fixes, feature requests, and improvements. But please read the following guidelines before submitting any pull requests.

## 💡 Before You Begin

- If you're fixing a bug or proposing a new feature, **open an issue first** to discuss it.
- For large changes, always start a discussion — avoid wasting effort on something that might not get merged.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m "Add feature"`.
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Open a **pull request** to the `main` branch.

## 💼 Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your code will be licensed under the same GPLv3 license as the project.
This ensures that the community benefits from your contribution — just like you're benefiting from this tool.
